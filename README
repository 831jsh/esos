ESOS (Enterprise Storage OS) is a Linux distribution of sorts that provides
block-level storage targets. Its based on the Linux kernel and the SCST
project. It also provides all of the necessary utilities/tools to configure
your back-end storage devices (eg, hardware RAID controllers, Logical Volume
Management, Linux software RAID, etc.). A text user interface (TUI) is also
included for storage provisioning and system management tasks.

ESOS has been actively developed since January 2012, and its feature set
continues to grow. Many people find ESOS to be quite stable and useful. Many
use ESOS in production / live environments.
